## Supplements Supporting Physical Health Restoration

### 1. Magnesium Glycinate
**The MVP of calm**

  - Improves cognitive recovery
  - Increases muscle strength
  - Repairs damage from chem-sex marathons
- **Dosage**: 5g/day consistently

### 4. NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine)
**The detox defender**

- **Purpose**: Combats oxidative stress from meth use

## Gut Health & Probiotics

### Why Gut Health Matters for Recovery

**The Gut-Brain Axis:**
- Gut bacteria directly influence brain chemistry

2. **Improve Psychiatric Symptoms**: Reduce psychosis, anxiety, insomnia
3. **Repair Gut Damage**: Restore healthy bacterial diversity
4. **Support Neurotransmitter Production**: Restore dopamine/serotonin pathways

### Recommended Probiotic Strains

- **Lactobacillus helveticus R0052** + **Bifidobacterium longum R0175**
- **Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG** - boosts dopamine, reduces inflammation
- **Lactobacillus acidophilus** - improves psychiatric symptoms
- **Bifidobacterium bifidum** - regulates dopamine levels

**Dosage**: 1.8 × 10⁹ CFU/day

### L-Glutamine (Gut Healer)
**Primary fuel for intestinal cells**

- **Benefits**:
  - Heals intestinal barrier damaged by meth
  - Reduces cravings
  - Supports dopamine production
  - Improves nutrient absorption
- **Dosage**: 5-10 grams daily (divided doses)
- **Synergy**: Works best with probiotics + prebiotics
