## The Neuropharmacology of Intoxication

### Five Key Substances

#### 1. Methamphetamine
**Mechanism of Action:**
- Blocks reuptake AND forces reverse transport of neurotransmitters
- Causes massive, uncontrolled release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin
- Most potent effect on dopamine system (highly reinforcing)

**Key Neurotransmitters:** Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Serotonin
**Receptor Targets:** DAT, NET, SERT (transporter inhibition); VMATs (vesicular transporters)

#### 2. Cocaine
**Mechanism of Action:**
- Blocks reuptake of neurotransmitters from synaptic cleft
- Causes accumulation and prolonged stimulation of postsynaptic receptors
- Intense euphoria and sense of reward

**Key Neurotransmitters:** Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Serotonin
**Receptor Targets:** DAT, NET, SERT (reuptake inhibition)

#### 3. Ecstasy (MDMA)
**Mechanism of Action:**
- Acts as substrate for monoamine transporters, causing massive release
- Higher affinity for serotonin transporter (SERT) than dopamine
- Disproportionately large serotonin release

**Key Neurotransmitters:** Serotonin (primary), Dopamine, Norepinephrine
**Receptor Targets:** SERT (high affinity), DAT, NET

**Neurotoxic Effects:**
- Depletes serotonin stores
- Long-term reduction in serotonin transporter density
- Potential for lasting damage to serotonergic neurons

#### 4. GHB (Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate / "Liquid G")
**Mechanism of Action:**
- Minor metabolite of GABA (primary inhibitory neurotransmitter)
- Activates GHB receptors and GABAB receptors
- Causes widespread neuronal inhibition

**Effects:**
- Sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant (therapeutic doses)
- Unconsciousness, respiratory depression (high doses)
- Rapid elimination (20-60 min half-life)

**Dangers:**
- High overdose risk due to short duration
- Profound CNS depression
- Often used in drug-facilitated sexual assault

#### 5. Marijuana (THC)
**Mechanism of Action:**
- Acts on endocannabinoid system
- Mimics endogenous cannabinoids
- Binds to CB1 receptors (brain and CNS)

**Effects:**
- Altered senses, mood changes
- Impaired thinking and coordination
- Affects memory, learning (especially in adolescents)

## Behavioral Consequences & Misconceptions

### Methamphetamine

**Common Misconception:** "It's just a stimulant; the main risk is getting caught."

**Evidence-Based Reality:**
- Causes long-term neurocognitive impairment (memory, attention, executive function)
- Youth users 13x more likely to have conduct disorder
- Increased justice system involvement
- Can cause life-threatening hyperthermia and sudden death
- Lasting brain damage even with moderate use

### Ecstasy (MDMA)

**Common Misconception:** "It's a safe, empathogenic party drug."

**Evidence-Based Reality:**
- Can cause anxiety, aggression, serotonin syndrome
- Neurotoxic to serotonin neurons
- Long-term mood disorders (depression, anxiety)
- Often adulterated with methamphetamine or ketamine
- Persistent negative mood states after use

### GHB ("Liquid G")

**Common Misconception:** "It's a natural brain chemical, so it's safe."

**Evidence-Based Reality:**
- Highly dangerous when misused
- Profound sedation and disinhibition
- High overdose risk (coma, fatal respiratory depression)
- Used in drug-facilitated sexual assault
- Strongly associated with high-risk sexual behaviors (chemsex)
- Increases HIV/STI transmission rates

### Cocaine

**Common Misconception:** "It's less dangerous than other hard drugs."

**Evidence-Based Reality:**
- High addiction and dependence potential
- Severe cardiovascular damage (heart attack, stroke)
- Tolerance requires larger doses
- Dysphoric withdrawal state
- Harsh legal penalties in Philippines (life imprisonment)

### Marijuana

**Common Misconception:** "It's non-addictive and just a mild recreational drug."

**Evidence-Based Reality:**
- Can be addictive (lower rate than heroin/cocaine, but substantial)
- Linked to psychotic disorders (especially in predisposed individuals)
- Impairs cognitive function in adolescents
- Increasing potency elevates risks
- Withdrawal symptoms can be challenging

- Reduces compulsive drug-seeking behavior

**Evidence:** Meta-analyses show effectiveness in reducing cravings across multiple substances

#### 4. Digital & VR Interventions
**Target:** General SUDs

**Benefits:**
- Enhances health literacy
- Reduces cravings
- Improves abstinence rates
- Interactive delivery of prevention/treatment content

#### 5. Conventional CBT/Contingency Management
**Target:** General SUDs

**Approach:**
- CBT: Changes thought patterns
- Contingency Management: Positive reinforcement

**Evidence:** Proven efficacy; gold-standard treatment components

## Food as Neurological Medicine

### Nutritional Strategy for Recovery

**Foundation Principle:** Food can actively support neurological repair, stabilize mood, and reduce cravings.

### Brain Fuel Foods

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA):**
- Vital for neuronal membrane structure and function
- **Sources:** Oily fish (salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines)
- **Dosage:** 3 servings/week + daily omega-3 capsule

**Antioxidant-Rich Nutrients:**
- **N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)** - reduces drug cravings
- **L-Carnitine** - supports energy metabolism
- **Alpha-Lipoic Acid** - powerful antioxidant
- **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)** - cellular energy production
- **Vitamin B Complex** - metabolic processes (often depleted in SUDs)

**Whole Foods:**
- Fresh fruits and vegetables
- Lean proteins
- Whole grains
- Ensures broad spectrum of micronutrients

### Foods to AVOID

❌ Highly processed foods
❌ Refined sugars
❌ Excessive caffeine
❌ Sugary drinks and juices
❌ Substances that interact with medications
❌ Foods that amplify negative drug effects

### Practical Daily Implementation

#### Brain Fuel
**Use:**
- Oily fish, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, berries
- Fresh vegetable juices (celery, cucumber, spinach)
- Omega-3, Vitamin B Complex, NAC supplements

**Avoid:**
- Processed snacks, white bread, sugary cereals, fried foods

**Tips:** 3 servings oily fish/week; keep water bottle to avoid sugary drinks

#### Hormone & Mood Support
**Use:**
- Lean proteins (chicken, turkey, legumes)
- Complex carbs (oats, quinoa, sweet potatoes)
- Magnesium-rich foods (dark chocolate, avocado)
- Fresh orange juice (moderation)
- L-Carnitine, Magnesium supplements

**Avoid:**
- High-glycemic foods, excessive caffeine, alcohol

**Rationale:** Balanced meals stabilize blood sugar and support serotonin production

#### Detoxification & Repair
**Use:**
- Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale)
- Garlic, onions
- Green juices with parsley and cilantro
- Glutathione, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, CoQ10 supplements

## Filipino Cultural Dynamics

### Stigma & Barriers to Help-Seeking

**Pervasive Stigma:**
- Social disapproval and discrimination
- Fear of being labeled "mentally ill"
- Family shame (hiya)
- Prevents help-seeking behavior

**Cultural Values:**

**Utang na loob (Gratitude/Obligation):**
- ✅ Positive: Fosters family ties, motivates recovery to avoid burdening loved ones
- ❌ Negative: Can create pressure and guilt

**Hiya (Shame/Dignity/Modesty):**
- ❌ Major barrier: Fear of bringing shame prevents disclosure
- ❌ Discourages seeking help from authorities/healthcare

**Pakikisama (Companionship/Group Harmony):**
- ❌ Can contribute to drug use (fitting in with peers)
- ✅ Can support recovery (community support)

### Philippine Government Response

**Historical Approach:**
- Law enforcement-oriented (Oplan Tokhang)
- Fear appeals (threats of imprisonment, torture, death)
- Criticized for human rights abuses

**Current Shift:**
- Public health approach
- Treatment and rehabilitation over punishment
- Philippine Youth Development Plan (PYDP) 2017-2022

**Treatment Models:**
- **ITRP** (Intensive Treatment and Rehabilitation Program) - residential
- **CBRP** (Community-based Rehabilitation and Wellness Program) - local communities

**Challenges:**
- Implementation and coordination issues
- Funding gaps (especially nutrition)
- Limited access in rural areas
- Geographic isolation
- Reliance on traditional healing practices

### Prevalence Data

**Filipino Adolescents (2019):**
- 1 in 7 engaged in current illicit drug use
- Most common: Methamphetamine ("shabu"), marijuana, inhalants
